# n8n Community Node Verification

## Scope

Use this repo-local skill in `/var/home/felipe/IdeaProjects/integrations-n8n` when adding, changing, or validating the n8n community node package at the repository root.

## When To Use

Use this skill when the task asks to:
- build or verify an n8n community node
- prove n8n loads a local custom node package
- execute a basic n8n workflow against a local community node
- debug package naming, node type IDs, credentials, or community-node linter failures
- debug Creator Portal submission errors involving npm package metadata, authors, or maintainers

Do not use this skill for ordinary TypeScript library tests, generic Docker checks, or n8n workflow design that does not involve a local community node package.

## Procedure

1. Inspect the package before changing behavior.
   - Confirm `package.json` name is either `n8n-nodes-*` or a scoped package whose unscoped name starts with `n8n-nodes-*`, such as `@scope/n8n-nodes-*`.
   - Confirm `package.json` has the `n8n` metadata pointing at built `dist` node and credential files.
   - For Creator Portal submission failures, inspect the live latest-version metadata from the npm registry as well as the local `package.json`; a published version can differ from the checkout.
   - Confirm `author` includes both `name` and `email`. Treat npm-generated `maintainers` and `_npmUser.email` as separate fields; do not assume the Creator Portal will use them when `author.email` is absent.
   - After correcting published metadata, release a new package version because npm versions are immutable, then verify the new latest metadata before retrying the submission.
   - When the package has action and trigger nodes, confirm every node entrypoint is listed in `package.json` `n8n.nodes`, included by the bundle/build script, and covered by the smoke import test.
   - Confirm the workflow node type is `<package-name>.<node-description-name>`, for example `n8n-nodes-atto.atto` or `@attocash/n8n-nodes-atto.atto`.

2. Build and lint using n8n tooling.
   - Run `npm install --ignore-scripts` if dependencies changed or a clean install is required; the n8n lint dependency declares a pnpm-only lifecycle guard even though the packages ship prebuilt.
   - Run `npm run build`.
   - Run `npm run lint`.
   - If the n8n linter rejects runtime dependencies, bundle package-only runtime code into the built node and keep n8n-provided packages external.
   - Keep bundled libraries in `devDependencies`, not `dependencies` or `peerDependencies`. Import them from one runtime adapter and bundle that adapter once; bundling every generated entrypoint duplicates large libraries.
   - When testing an unreleased package through a source symlink, set esbuild `preserveSymlinks: true` so transitive packages resolve from the consuming package's `node_modules`.
   - A source import of a deliberately bundled library may require a narrow `no-restricted-imports` disable. Verify the packed JavaScript has no unresolved import before accepting the disable.
   - Before building extensive coverage around a new runtime dependency, pack the smallest integration and scan that exact artifact. Abort the dependency approach early if generated code introduces scanner-forbidden globals or Node built-ins.
   - For persistent NDJSON APIs, a scanner-safe fallback is n8n's `helpers.httpRequest` with `encoding: 'stream'`, an `AbortSignal`, and endpoint DTOs verified against the canonical client source. Keep the protocol/model library bundled if it passes independently; do not bundle a generated transport merely to preserve its wrapper API.
   - For CI artifacts, run `npm pack --pack-destination artifacts` after tests and upload `artifacts/*.tgz`.
   - If sandboxed `npm pack` fails writing to the host npm cache, rerun with an isolated cache such as `npm --cache /tmp/npm-cache pack --pack-destination <dir>`.
   - For npm releases, use package-scoped semantic-release tags such as `n8n-node-vX.Y.Z`; do not use `package.json` as the CI release source of truth.
   - Compute the release from the repository root with `cycjimmy/semantic-release-action` in dry-run mode and `tagFormat: n8n-node-v${version}`.
   - In this repo, release-producing commits should use the `n8n-node` conventional-commit scope, such as `fix(n8n-node): ...`, `perf(n8n-node): ...`, or `feat(n8n-node): ...`.
   - Before packing in CI, apply the computed package version with `npm version "$VERSION" --no-git-tag-version --allow-same-version`; the repository package version may remain a placeholder or previous release.
   - On main pushes, create the attempted package artifact before release approval, then gate semantic-release tag creation, GitHub Release creation, and npm publish behind the GitHub environment named `release`.
   - Publish n8n community nodes from GitHub Actions with `npm publish --provenance --access public` using npm Trusted Publishing; do not add `NPM_TOKEN` fallback paths.
   - Trusted Publishing requires a new enough CI toolchain. Use Node 24 for the publish workflow, install npm `^11.5.1`, and fail early if `node` or `npm` is below npm's current OIDC minimums.

3. Test the node outside n8n first.
   - Unit-test operation helpers and n8n `execute()` behavior.
   - Include a smoke test that imports built `dist` node and credential files.
   - For integration tests, prefer the real local/mock service utilities exposed by the upstream library rather than manually faking protocol behavior.

4. Verify in real n8n with Podman.
   - Build first.
   - Use a writable n8n user folder and mount the package under `nodes/node_modules`.
   - For rootless Podman host-directory permission issues, run the verification container as root inside the container and set `N8N_USER_FOLDER=/home/node`.

Example server command:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/n8n-local-verify/.n8n/nodes/node_modules
podman run --rm -it --user 0 -p 5678:5678 \
  -e N8N_USER_FOLDER=/home/node \
  -e N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED=true \
  -e N8N_SECURE_COOKIE=false \
  -v /tmp/n8n-local-verify:/home/node:Z \
  -v "$PWD:/home/node/.n8n/nodes/node_modules/<package-name>:ro,Z" \
  docker.io/n8nio/n8n:latest
```

5. Execute a minimal workflow through n8n.
   - Use `import:workflow --input=<file>` followed by `execute --id=<workflow-id> --rawOutput`.
   - Use a generated local test secret only in temporary files, never in repo files or final output.
   - Prefer a local-only derive/format workflow for smoke execution when the package supports one; it proves node registration and execution without external service credentials.
   - Include at least one workflow that omits UI-defaulted parameters such as `operation`; this catches `Could not get parameter` failures that unit tests with explicit parameters can miss.
   - For trigger nodes, add a direct unit test around `trigger.trigger.call(ctx)` with a context whose `getNodeParameter` throws unless the node supplies a fallback. Use the trigger signature `getNodeParameter(name, fallback)`, not the action-node signature `getNodeParameter(name, itemIndex, fallback)`.
   - Do not run `n8n execute` inside the same live server process/container if the task broker port is already in use. Stop the server after the HTTP/UI load check, then run a one-shot n8n CLI container with the same temporary user folder and package mount.
   - Delete temporary n8n user folders that contain workflow secrets after verification.

6. Verify credential tests through n8n when changing credential definitions.
   - Start a temporary n8n server with the package mounted.
   - Use the REST API to set up a disposable owner, create a disposable credential, then call `POST /rest/credentials/test`.
   - Treat `{"status":"OK","message":"Connection successful!"}` as the credential-test pass condition.
   - Use disposable wallet material only, because n8n stores the credential in the temporary user folder.

7. For checkout-based installs inside an n8n container, keep host installs isolated.
   - Add a package script that builds, validates, packs, and installs the `.tgz` into `${N8N_USER_FOLDER:-$HOME/.n8n}/nodes`.
   - Default to build plus a local smoke validation; make full tests opt-in because containerized n8n often lacks Docker or Podman access for integration tests.
   - Verify installer behavior in an ephemeral Podman container by copying the package source into the container and installing only into the container filesystem.

## Pitfalls

- Mounting only the package directory can leave `/home/node/.n8n/nodes` unwritable; mount a writable parent user folder too.
- `N8N_USER_FOLDER=/home/node/.n8n` creates a nested `.n8n` folder; use `N8N_USER_FOLDER=/home/node`.
- If `curl http://127.0.0.1:5678` cannot reach a container that logs as ready, set `N8N_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0`; if a sandbox still blocks local networking, rerun the local curl check outside the sandbox.
- n8n CLI execution does not accept `--file` reliably in current images; import the workflow and execute by ID.
- n8n CLI execution can conflict with a running server on the task broker port; use a one-shot CLI container against the same user folder after stopping the server.
- n8n may print node parameters on failed CLI executions, so store real wallet/API secrets in credentials and use disposable test secrets only for workflow verification.
- n8n credential save/test failures can come from the credential `test.request`, even when the credential data itself is valid. Check the exact route in the credential definition before debugging wallet fields.
- UI-created nodes may not persist default values for every parameter. Use `getNodeParameter(name, itemIndex, fallback)` for action-node defaults and `getNodeParameter(name, fallback)` for trigger-node defaults.
- n8n community node type IDs are package-qualified, for example `n8n-nodes-atto.atto` or `@attocash/n8n-nodes-atto.atto`, even when the UI display name is shorter.
- GitHub Actions artifact downloads are zip files; for n8n installation testing, extract the downloaded artifact and use the packaged `.tgz` inside it.
- Do not verify checkout installers against the host `~/.n8n`; use a temporary directory or, preferably, an ephemeral Podman n8n container.
- For npm Trusted Publishing, configure npm with the exact GitHub workflow filename used by the publish job.
- Do not assume Node 22's bundled npm supports Trusted Publishing; Node can satisfy the runtime requirement while npm is still too old for OIDC publishing.
- Do not add an `NPM_TOKEN` secret fallback for this package; token auth hides Trusted Publishing misconfiguration and is not the intended release path.
- In a multi-integration repository, avoid repo-wide `vX.Y.Z` tags for n8n releases; they collide with unrelated integration versions.
- Do not let package-created release tags retrigger the package workflow; the approved release job should create the tag after the artifact has already been tested and packed.
- Do not make release jobs derive the next n8n version from `package.json`; that will retry an already-created tag after the first successful release.
- Do not diagnose `Error getting author email from npm` from the npm website sidebar or maintainer profile alone. Inspect the live latest-version `author.email` field directly.
- Kotlin/JS bundles can retain the browser-only `BufferedOutputToConsoleLog` through metadata registration even after console calls are dropped. For Node-only packages, remove the unreachable browser fallback during bundling and assert the class name is absent from the packed artifact.
- A standalone incremental `tsc --noEmit` can recreate `dist/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` after the production build removed it. Run the production build immediately before packing and inspect the tarball contents.
- Run test files serially because the integration and trigger suites share local mock/container resources and can fail nondeterministically when Node schedules them concurrently.

## Verification

Before finishing, run:
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`
- `npm pack --pack-destination <temporary-artifact-directory>`
- extract the exact tarball and confirm both root and nested `dist/package.json` have no `dependencies`
- run the official scanner's local package analyzer against the extracted tarball before publication; scanning the npm package name checks the previously published version instead
- when a transport dependency is under evaluation, run that exact-tarball scanner gate before the full integration and n8n runtime suite
- import and execute a bundled operation from the extracted package with no bundled-library package installed, while supplying only n8n's peer dependency
- load `release.config.cjs` and confirm `tagFormat` is `n8n-node-v${version}`
- parse or lint the GitHub Actions workflow after release-flow edits; use `actionlint` when available
- `npm publish <tarball> --dry-run --access public` with an isolated npm cache when the host cache is read-only
- `npm view "$PACKAGE_NAME@latest" author maintainers --json` and confirm `author.email` is present for Creator Portal submissions
- a Podman n8n start check that reaches `http://127.0.0.1:5678`
- a minimal n8n workflow execution that uses the community node type

Confirm there is no leftover n8n verification container and remove any temporary n8n user folder that may contain generated test secrets.

## Trigger Examples

Should use:
- "verify this n8n community node loads in n8n"
- "run a real n8n workflow against the local custom node"
- "why is my n8n community node type called n8n-nodes-foo.bar?"
- "why does creators.n8n.io say Error getting author email from npm?"

Should not use:
- "write a generic TypeScript unit test"
- "design an n8n workflow using built-in nodes only"
